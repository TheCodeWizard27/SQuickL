# SQuickL
Quick Access for MSSQL Database on Command Line

# Info
In order for SQuickL to work both pyodbc 
and the odbc driver from Microsoft need to be installed.

Installing pyodbc Windows
```
    <pip path>/pip install 
```
Installing pyodbc Linux
```
    sudo -H pip install pyodbc
```

The odbc driver should come with MSSQL.
